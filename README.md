## Fusion strategy (two attention models)  
In our fusion strategy, we focus on two types of features: spatial attention model and channel attention model. The extracted multi-scale deep features are processed in two phases.

## NestFuse for RGBT visual object tracking
In this experiment, we choose SiamRPN++ \cite{li2019siamrpn++} as the base tracker and the fusion strategy proposed in this paper is applied to do the feature-level fusion. The SiamRPN++ is based on deep learning and achieves the state-of-the-art tracking performance in 2019.
